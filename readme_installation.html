<h1>Welcome to phpScheduleIt 2.1!</h1>

<h2><span STYLE="color:#727E0A">Prerequisites</span></h2>

<ul>
	<li>PHP 5.2 or greater.</li>
	<li>MySQL 5.0 or greater.</li>
	<li>Web server (Apache2, IIS).</li>
	<li>OS - Windows, Mac, *nix</li>
</ul>
<div STYLE="font-style: italic;">
	Note: for users without web hosting service or existing environment, packages like <a
		href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/index.html">XAMMP</a> or <a href="http://www.wampserver.com/en/">WampServer</a>
	can help you get set up quicky.<br/>
</div>

<h1 class="section">Fresh Installation</h1>

<h2>Application Deployment to Server</h2>

<div>
	<ul>
		<li>Unzip the archived distribution to your webserver's document root. Or</li>
		<li>If you don't have direct access to your document root or use hosting service,
			then transfer the extracted directory to your web server's document root using FTP or <a
					href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/winscp/">WinSCP</a>.
		</li>
		<li>Copy /config/config.dist.php to /config/config.php and adjust the settings for your environment.</li>
		<li><span STYLE="color:red">Important!</span> The web server must have write access (0770) to
			/your-phpScheduleIt/tpl_c and /your-phpScheduleIt/tpl
			<a href="http://www.smarty.net/docs/en/variable.compile.dir.tpl">(want to know why?)</a>
			<ul>
				<li>If using an FTP client, check read/write/execute for Owner and Group on /tpl, /tpl_c, and /uploads</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<h2>Application Configuration</h2>

<div>
	You can configure phpScheduleIt to fit your environments and needs, or use the minimal default settings which should
	be enough for the application to work. We recommend you to change according to your specifics. Additional
	information on all configuration settings can be found in the application help page.
	<ul>
		<li>To configure the application, you can open /config/config.php and alter any settings accordingly.
			The admin email address can be set in the phpScheduleIt/config/config.php file of setting
			<span class="setting">$conf['settings']['admin.email']</span>.<br/>
			When later register an account with admin email address the user will be given admin privilege.
		</li>
		<li>In addition, to allow resource image uploads, the web-server must also have read/write
			access to your configurable uploads directory of <span class="setting">$conf['settings']['image.upload.directory']</span>
			in the config.php.
		</li>
		<li>By default, phpScheduleIt uses standard username/password for user authentication. Alternatively, you can
			use LDAP authentication.
			<br/>See the plugins section of the application help page for more details.
		</li>
	</ul>
	Note: If you try to load the application at this time (eg. http://yourhostname/phpScheduleIt/Web/), you will
	probably get a white page. This is because there is no backend database configured yet. So continue on ...
</div>

<h2>Database Setup</h2>
You have 2 ways to set up your database for the application to work.

<h3>Automatically</h3>

<div>You must have the application configured correctly before running the automated install.</div>

<div>
	<ul>
		<li>The automated database setup only supports MySQL at this time. To run the automated database setup, navigate
			to the
			/Web/install directory in a web browser and follow the on-screen instructions.
		</li>
		<li>Note: Some may see directory permission issues displayed on the page. The web server must have write access
			to /your-phpScheduleIt/tpl_c and /your-phpScheduleIt/tpl.
			If you cannot provide the required permission. Contact your web server administrator or hosting service to
			resolve or run the manual install.
		</li>
	</ul>
</div>

OR<br/>

<h3>Manually</h3>

<div>
	The packaged database scripts make assumptions about your desired database configuration and set default values.
	Please edit them to suit your environment before running. The files are located in
	phpScheduleIt/database_schema/. <br/> <br/>
	Import the following sql files in the listed order (we recommend <a
		href="http://www.phpmyadmin.net/documentation/">phpMyAdmin</a> for this):
</div>

<div>
	<h4>On a remote host</h4>

	<p>If you are installing phpScheduleIt on a remote host, please follow these steps. These steps assume you are using
		cPanel.</p>

	<p>Adding the database and user</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Select the MySQL Databases tool</li>
		<li>Add a new user with username and password of your choice. This will be the username and password used in
			your phpScheduleIt config file.
		</li>
		<li>Create a new database with whatever name you choose. This will be the name of the database in your
			phpScheduleIt config file. 'phpSchedlueIt2' is the recommended database name.
		</li>
		<li>Associate the new user with the new database, giving the user permission to SELECT, CREATE, UPDATE, INSERT
			and DELETE. Click the 'Add User to Db' button.
	</ul>


	<p>Creating tables</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Open phpMyAdmin.</li>
		<li>Click on the database name that you just created in the left panel.</li>
		<li>Click the SQL tab at the top of the page.</li>
		<li>Import "/database_schema/schema-utf8.sql" to phpscheduleit2</li>
		<li>Import "/database_schema/data-utf8.sql" to phpscheduleit2</li>
	</ul>

</div>
<div>
	<h4>If you have access to MySQL</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Run/import "/database_schema/create-db.sql" to mysql db (phpscheduleit2 db created)</li>
		<li>Run/import "/database_schema/schema-utf8.sql" to phpscheduleit2 (db schema created)</li>
		<li>Run/import "/database_schema/create-user.sql" to mysql db (schedule_user/password mysql account created to
			match to your default configuration
			and notice that this is not the application user!). <br/>
			At this point with the aforementioned default configuration in your-phpScheduleIt/config/config.php
			your application can connect to the database and loaded eg. see
			http://localhost/your-phpScheduleIt/Web/index.php
			but you can not login since there is no application data or user, so go to next step
		</li>
		<li>Run/import "/database_schema/data-utf8.sql" to phpscheduleit2 (initializing application database)</li>
		<li>Optionally - run/import "/database_schema/testdata-utf8.sql" to phpscheduleit2 (sample application data will
			be created with 2 users:
			admin/password and user/password). These users are available for testing your installation.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<span STYLE="color:green;">You are done. Congratulations!</span>
	Try to load the application at (eg. http://yourhostname/phpScheduleIt/Web/).
</div>


<h1 class="section">Upgrading</h1>
<a name="upgrading"></a>

<h2>Upgrading from a previous version of phpScheduleIt 2</h2>

<div>
	The steps for upgrading from a previous version of phpScheduleIt 2 are very similar to the steps described above in
	Application Deployment to Server.

	<h3>Recommended</h3>

	<p>The recommended approach is to backup your current phpScheduleIt files, then upload the new files to the
		that same location. This prevents any old files from interfering with new ones.</p>

	<p>After the new files are uploaded, copy your old config/config.php file to the config directory in the new
		version. Then run /Web/install/configure.php to bring your config file up to date.</p>

	<p>If you have any uploaded resource images you will need to copy them from their old location to the new
		one.</p>

	<h3>Alternative</h3>

	<p>An alternative upgrade approach is to overwrite the current phpScheduleIt files with the new ones. If doing this,
		you must delete the contents of /tpl_c. This approach will not allow you to roll back and will not clear out any
		obsolete files.</p>

	<h3>Database</h3>

	<p>
		After the application files have been upgraded you will need to upgrade the database.
	</p>

	<h4>Automatically</h4>

	<p>The automatic database upgrade is exactly the same as the automatic database install. Please follow the
		instructions in the Automatic Database Setup section above.</p>

	<h4>Manually</h4>

	<div>
		The packaged database scripts make assumptions about your desired database configuration and set default values.
		Please edit them to suit your environment before running. The files are located in
		phpScheduleIt/database_schema/upgrades. <br/> <br/>
		Depending on your current version, import the upgrade.sql file within each subdirectory to get to the current
		version (we recommend <a
			href="http://www.phpmyadmin.net/documentation/">phpMyAdmin</a> for this).<br/><br/>
		For example, if you are running version 2.0 and the current version is 2.2 then you should run
		phpScheduleIt/database_schema/upgrade/2.1/upgrade.sql then phpScheduleIt/database_schema/upgrade/2.2/upgrade.sql
	</div>
</div>

<h2>Migrating from version 1.2</h2>

<div>A migration from 1.2 to 2.0 is supported for MySQL only. This can be run after the 2.0 installation. To run the
	migration open /Web/install/migrate.php directory in a web browser and follow the on-screen instructions.
</div>

<h1 class="section">Getting Started</h1>

<h2>The First Login</h2>

<div>There are 2 main types of accounts, they are admin and user account.</div>

<ul>
	<li>If you imported a sample application data, you now can use admin/password and user/password to login and make
		changes or addition via the application.
	</li>
	<li>If not, you will need to register an account with your configured admin email address. The admin email address
		can be set in the phpScheduleIt/config/config.php file of setting <span class="setting">$conf['settings']['admin.email']</span>.
		Other self registration accounts are defaulted to normal users.<br/>
		After registration you will be logged in automatically. <span STYLE="color:red">Important!</span> At this time,
		it is recommended to change your password immediately. Notice that an email address is required to register for
		an account.
	</li>
	<li>For LDAP authentication please login with your LDAP username/password.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Log Files</h2>
phpScheduleIt logs multiple levels of information categorized into either application or database logs. To do this, the
log4php library is used. By default, logging is turned OFF.
<ul>
	<li>First, rename /config/log4php.config.dist.xml to /config/log4php.config.xml</li>
	<li>To allow application logging, the PHP account requires write access (0755) to your configured log directory.
	</li>
	<li>Logging is configured in /config/log4php.config.xml
		<ul>
			<li>For Windows, set the path to something similar to &lt;param name=&quot;file&quot; value=&quot;c:/temp/log_%s.log&quot;
				/&gt;</li>
			<li>For Unix, set the path to something similar to &lt;param name=&quot;file&quot; value=&quot;/tmp/phpscheduleit/log_%s.log&quot;
				/&gt;</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Logging is controlled by changing the &lt;level&gt; of each &lt;logger&gt;</li>
	<li>Levels used by phpScheduleIt are OFF, DEBUG, ERROR. For normal operation, ERROR is appropriate. If trace logs
		are needed, DEBUG is appropriate.
	</li>
	<li>To turn on application logging, change the &lt;level value=&quot;OFF&quot; /&gt; to an appropriate level for
		either the default or sql loggers.
		For example, &lt;level value=&quot;ERROR&quot; /&gt;</li>
	<li>For more information on logging configuration, visit <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4php/">log4php</a>
	</li>
</ul>
